   = help: retags occur on all (re)borrows and as well as when references are copied or moved
   = help: retags permit optimizations that insert speculative reads or writes
   = help: therefore from the perspective of data races, a retag has the same implications as a read or write
   = help: this indicates a bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, and caused Undefined Behavior
   = help: see https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html for further information
